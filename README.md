# FindBinOp
General research on a conpect I created called Binary Operator Network
A binary neural network is a neural network along with a set of biases which together can represent the space of all binary operations
In this case binary means 0 and 1.

In mathamatical notation the set of binary numbers is {0,1} and I will denote it as B.
and binary operator network would be all F: BxB -> B
F has 16 different members which corresespond to different binary gates/operations.
